# Atomic Operations

The 30 fundamental operations that form the basis of all Combinatronix AI.

## Categories

1. **Pattern Primitives** (5 atoms) - Basic patterns
2. **Combinatorial** (5 atoms) - Pure combinators
3. **Field Dynamics** (5 atoms) - Spatial operations
4. **Tension Resolvers** (5 atoms) - Cognitive tension handling
5. **Temporal** (5 atoms) - Time-based operations
6. **Multi-Field** (5 atoms) - Cross-field operations

## Usage

```python
from combinatronix.atoms.pattern_primitives import pulse
from combinatronix.atoms.combinatorial import witness

# Create and apply atom
atom = pulse.PulseAtom(frequency=1.0)
result = atom.apply(field)
```

## Philosophy

Each atom:
- Is 10-50 lines of code
- Has zero dependencies on other atoms
- Represents a fundamental cognitive operation
- Composes with other atoms to form molecules
