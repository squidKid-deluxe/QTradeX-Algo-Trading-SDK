## Combinator Calculus

Base combinators: S, K, I, B, C, W, Y

### S Combinator (Application)
```
S f g x = f x (g x)
```
Applies both functions to input, combines results.

### K Combinator (Constant)
```
K x y = x
```
Returns first argument, ignores second.

### I Combinator (Identity)
```
I x = x
```
Returns input unchanged - pure observation.

## Field Theory

Fields are N-dimensional analog spaces where:
- Activation propagates via diffusion, waves, or other modes
- Patterns emerge from field dynamics
- Memory accumulates through signal traces

## Cognitive Architecture

Intelligence emerges from:
1. Pattern resonance (recognition)
2. Field tensions (cognitive dissonance)
3. Symbol invention (concept creation)
4. Combinatorial composition (reasoning)

## Why This Works

Traditional AI: Learn statistical patterns from data
Combinatronix: Reason with fundamental cognitive operations

The 30 atoms are not learned - they're discovered as the minimal
set of operations needed for general intelligence.
